<h1>Analyze day by day</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>If you are really into documenting your profits
every market day, these packages are for you.</p>

<p>Using the packages here can help you monitor 
your profits easily and give you some cool graphs
and knowledge about your return's progress.</p>

<p>You can also document monthly if you'd like to.</p>

<h2>Excel creating</h2>

<p>If you want to create an Excel that can work perfectly
with my code, I suggest you using the Excel creating
package. It has not a lot of functions but if you use it,
your excel should work perfectly with my codes.</p>

<p>P.S. The dates in your Excel, either if you create
it by yourself or if you create it using my code, should 
be in the format of day-month-year.</p>

<h2>Main</h2>

<h3>Initiating the class</h3>

<p>In order to initiate the class you can use the
example below. date_column and profit_column
are not mandatory but will prevent you answering 
input in the init section</p>

    launch = ProfitMonitor(
        path="",
        date_column="date",
        profit_column="profit"
    )
